      "text": "Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis) is a twining annual legume common throughout the tropics. Growth is confined to the wet season; vines die back with cold. Plants have large trifoliate leaves and vigorous stems up to 2–3 m long. The flowers are purple or white, borne in drooping racemes. The pods are velvety and contain 3–6 seeds. Seeds are typically black, white, or mottled."

      "text": "Velvet bean offers multiple benefits to farmers: 1) Nitrogen fixation - can fix 150-300 kg N/ha, reducing fertilizer needs; 2) Soil improvement - deep taproot breaks compacted layers and adds organic matter; 3) Weed suppression - dense canopy suppresses weeds naturally; 4) Livestock feed - young leaves and pods are high in protein; 5) Ground cover - protects soil from erosion during rainy season."

      "text": "Plant velvet bean at the start of the rainy season. Seed rate: 20-25 kg/ha when broadcasting, 15-20 kg/ha when planted in rows. Plant 2-3 cm deep in rows 30-45 cm apart. Seeds should be inoculated with rhizobia before planting for optimal nitrogen fixation. The crop is tolerant to poor soils but performs best on well-drained fertile soils with pH 5.5-7.0."
